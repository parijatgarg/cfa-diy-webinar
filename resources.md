### Learning Python

* Video on installing Python and code editor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXotpMFG380&list=PLboXykqtm8dy_DNg1NZiS08Dnyj35PWXw&index=1
* Kaggle has some really nice learning resources. Some very basics about Python can be picked up at https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python
* If you are new to programming or python, don't pick up a book directly about python for finance. Prefer a book/course that teaches you the basics of programming and general purpose applications. 
* The best way to learn python beyond the basics is to try and solve more and more actual problems. For example, challenge yourself to write a program to extract the biggest moving stocks on any given day - from the Bhavcopy file downloaded from NSE.
* Stackoverflow is a great resource to get answers to specific questions and problems. You will almost never have to actually post a question. Somebody would have already asked it for you. So search on stackoverflow or even google directly when you get stuck.
* Once you are comfortable with getting data in and our of files, writing short functions to do various things, pick up any course that teaches you how to use the pandas library. Beyond that, its all learn as you go.


### Practicing Data Science and algo trading

* kaggle.com is probably the best known platform today to challenge yourself with datascience problems. 
* to practice and learn writing proper quantitative investing strategies, you can visit quantopian.com. The downside is that the code you write there depends on the libraries provided by quantopian. However, it is a good place to begin testing your ideas about quant investing - rather than getting tied up in the nitty gritty of getting data and building all the related infrastructure.


### Books on Algos

To be honest, there are few books on algo trading that tell you anything more than superficial strategy related stuff. The only books I've come across that honestly talk about (some of) the real-world challenges of building a good strategy and back testing it are by Ernie Chan. You can find information about his books at https://www.epchan.com/books/
